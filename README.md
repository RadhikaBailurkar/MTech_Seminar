# SMARTPHONE AUTHENTICATION USING SOFT BIOMETRICS

#Phase 1 

The rise of smartphone usage has shed a light on its authentication mechanism. Several proposed techniques like PIN based access, password based or even biometric
provide only one time authentication. Hence, Continuous Authentication was proposed by several authors who have worked on keystroke dynamics, Hard Biometrics.
A look at literature survey gives us an idea of continuous measurement/collection of users features and evaluating them on the basis of classifiers justified by the authors.

Objectives

  @ To study basics of continuous authentication on smart-phone touch screen.
  
  @ To do comparative analysis of different methodologies.
  
  @ To provide solution, to design more efficient authentication system for user using smartphone touch screen


#Phase 2

In depth study of comparative analysis gave us an insight about the features choosen and the accuracy or results obtained on the basis of the performance metrics used.
FRR,FAR,ERR and ROC were most popularly used metrics. A workflow model was developed which consists of preparation, identification and countermeasures.
Gaps

  @ Touch based results vary for different Mobile Model. For instance, the screen of different phones have slightly different dimensions.
  
  @ we report that combining multiple features gives better results than using each single feature alone[Elaine Shi]
  
  @ Sometimes an impersonator might mimic the touch behaviour of another user.(For example, he can be a friend, coworker or a family member)
  
  @ Increase the feature space by including a categorical variable that records values like ‘read e-mail’, ‘write e-mail’, ‘browse’, ‘control music player’
  
  @ Influence of sample size
